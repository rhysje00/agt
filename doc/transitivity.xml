<Heading>Transitivity properties of graphs</Heading>

In this chapter we give functions used to investgiate various transitivity 
properties of graphs.

Given a graph <M>\Gamma = (V,E)</M>, a function <M>\phi:V\to V</M> is an 
<E>automorphism</E> of <M>\Gamma</M> if it is a bijection such that for all
<M>v,w\in V</M>, <M>v,w</M> are adjacent in <M>\Gamma</M> if and only if 
<M>\phi(v),\phi(w)</M> are adjacent in <M>\Gamma</M>.

A graph <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>regular</E> with <E>parameters</E> <M>(v,k)</M>
if <M>\Gamma</M> is simple and undirected, it has order <M>v</M>, 
and every vertex of <M>\Gamma</M> has degree <M>k</M>.

# Graph constructors for AGT

This branch is for the inclusion of graph constructors in the AGT package. 
Currently, we have included the package of constructors of Vidali found at

<https://github.com/jaanos/gap-graphs.git>

almost identically, with slight adjustments. Mainly,

- We use the delcaration/implementation structure of GAP4
- To avert a clash of function definition for HammingGraph with grape, 
  we have temporarily renamed our function HammingGraph2
- Similarly, we currently have other graphs defined multiple times, for which we do the same.

This is a work in progress.


# The AGT package for GAP

The AGT package contains a methods used for the determination of  various 
algebraic and regularity properties of graphs, as well as certain substructures 
of graphs. The package also contains a library of strongly regular graphs,
intended to be a useful resource for computational experiments.

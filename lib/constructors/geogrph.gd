# The incidence graph of a Desarguesian projective plane.

DeclareGlobalFunction( "HallPlaneIncidenceGraph" );

# The incidence graph of a Hughes plane. If the second parameter n is zero or
# unspecified, a Dickson semifield of order q^2 is used and the first parameter
# q must be an odd prime power. Otherwise, an exceptional near-field of order
# q^2 is used, so q must be 5, 7, 11, 23, 29, or 59. As there are two
# exceptional near-fields of order 11^2, setting n to 1 or 2 chooses one of
# these semifields when q = 11.
